# minimal-sum-vertex-weighted-graph-coloring-algorithms

Given a vertex-weighted graph, find 3 approximate algorithms that color this graph in a way where the
sum of the heaviest vertices of each color is minimized.

In order to generate and test graphs execute the main() method of an auxiliary Tester class. Algorithms can be run separately as well.
